                <h2 class="desc">CHEST</h2>
            </div>
            <p class="text">
                The chest includes some of the largest muscles in the upper body and you use the chest muscles all day long. It's important to keep these muscles strong for all your daily activities. 
                <br> <br> 
                The chest muscles are responsible for moving the arms across the body and up and down, as well as other movements like flexion, adduction, and rotation. Most chest exercises involve pushing the arms away from the body or the body away from the arms.

                <h2 class="desc">TRICEPS</h2>
            </div>
            <p class="text" id="text3">
                The triceps, or triceps brachii, is Latin for the three-head muscle of the arm made up of three separate muscles — long, medial, and lateral head — with different origins, but they all converge in the same place on the elbow.
                <br> <br> 
                The triceps long head is the biggest of the three muscles and originates at the infraglenoid tubercle of the scapula. Because the long head crosses two joints, the shoulder, and the elbow, it’s involved in some overhead movements like lat pulldowns and chinups.
